## My Web App

This app shows pitcher tendencies agaisnt right handed and left handed batters. Go to the apps folder to see the code. It was all done with python. I know it is a little clunky, but I built this over a year agao and I've improved. However, this was my first massive project and I leanred a lot of python from it.
